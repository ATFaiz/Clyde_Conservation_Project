1.	Conservation System Project is a software application designed to manage and track information related to animal conservation efforts.
2.	The project aims to facilitate the management of animals, keepers, and cages within a conservation organization.
3.	It allows for the creation and management of animal records, including their identification, name, sex, type, category, date of birth, and cage assignment.
4.	Keepers can be assigned to cages and managed within the system, including their identification, name, address, contact number, and position.
5.	Cages are defined with attributes such as cage ID, size, type, maximum animal capacity, and maximum keeper capacity.
6.	The project supports functionality for assigning and unassigning animals and keepers to cages, ensuring proper allocation and capacity management.
7.	It provides features to generate reports on the current status of cages, animals, and keepers, including animals not assigned to a cage and keepers not assigned to maximum cages.
8.	The system utilizes file I/O operations to read and write data to text files for data persistence.
9.	Validation mechanisms are implemented to ensure proper input and error handling when interacting with the system.
10.	The project is implemented using object-oriented programming principles, with classes such as Animal, Keeper, Cage, and FileIO to organize and manage data and operations.
11.	The Conservation System Project aims to improve efficiency and organization in the management of animal conservation efforts, supporting the overall goals of conservation organizations.
